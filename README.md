# GuiTestIni

I only know basic programming so you can only see basic codes and some are repetitious. You are free to edit.

AutoHotkey Gui Buttons that you can edit in INI file. 
The buttons also interact with the last application you open. 
Save your most typed words or sentences in the button.

IMPORTANT: Save or copy details.ini on your desktop or you can change the location in the GuiTestIni.ahk code.

Thank you
